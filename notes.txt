Building a Flask chat and video application with Socket.IO can be more complex than the previous example,
as it involves real-time video streaming and handling WebRTC connections. However,
I can provide you with an overview of the steps involved. Here's a high-level outline of the process:

    1. Set up the Flask app and SocketIO, similar to the previous example.

    2. Create an HTML template that includes video elements for the local and remote streams, as well as buttons for starting and stopping the video call.

    3. Implement the signaling server using SocketIO. This server will handle the WebRTC signaling process, such as exchanging session descriptions (SDP) and ICE candidates between the clients.

    4. Define event handlers in your Flask app to handle WebRTC signaling messages sent through SocketIO. These handlers will parse the messages and forward them to the appropriate clients.

    5. Implement the WebRTC functionality in JavaScript on the client-side. This includes creating a peer connection, capturing the local video stream, sending signaling messages, and handling remote stream reception.

    6. Connect the Flask app, SocketIO, and WebRTC components. When a user initiates a video call, the appropriate signaling messages will be sent through SocketIO, allowing the clients to establish a WebRTC connection.

    7. Handle the video call logic in your Flask app. This involves forwarding video streams between clients, displaying the local and remote video streams, and handling actions like starting and stopping the video call.


Please note that building a complete video chat application requires a more detailed implementation and
handling of various edge cases. You may need to refer to WebRTC documentation and tutorials for a deeper 
understanding of the technology and its implementation. Additionally, it's essential to consider security 
aspects, such as encryption and user authentication, to ensure a secure and reliable video chat experience.

Given the complexity of building a real-time video chat application, it may be helpful to explore existing libraries
and frameworks that simplify the process, such as SimpleWebRTC, Twilio Video, or OpenTok. These frameworks provide higher-level 
abstractions and take care of many of the underlying complexities of WebRTC.
